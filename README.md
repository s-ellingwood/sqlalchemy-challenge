# SQLAlchemy Challenge

## Project Background

### **Instructions**
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area.

**Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data**

In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

**Part 2: Design Your Climate App**

Now that you’ve completed your initial analysis, you’ll design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed.

### Data source:
All used data in this project is provided by UNC Chapel Hill’s Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp.

### Files:
All important files for this project are in the WeatherAnalysis folder.
- The Resources folder contains 3 files:
    - hawaii.sqlite - contains the database used to find classes and create the session in climate_starter.ipynb
    - hawaii_measurements.csv - contains information on the station code, the date of the entry, and the precipitation level and temperature recorded.
    - hawaii_stations.csv - contains information on the code, name, latitude, longitude, and elevation of each station.
- app.py - contains code for Part 2, used to create the Flask app.
- climate_starter.ipynb - contains the code used to
- CrowdfundingBook.xlsx - contains all the code for Part 1, used to analyze data, and answer project questions.
